# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, Render, and MongoDB Atlas

This project sets up a **full-stack application** with a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** for testing and **Render** for automatic deployment upon merging to the main branch. It also connects to **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud database storage.

---

## 🛠️ **Key Features**
- **Cypress Component Testing** triggered on Pull Requests to the `develop` branch.
- **Automatic Deployment to Render** when the `develop` branch is merged into `main`.
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration** as the cloud database.

## 🧑‍💻 **How It Works**
1. **Feature branches** → Pull Requests into `develop`.
2. **GitHub Actions Cypress Tests** → Runs automatically.
3. **Merge `develop` → `main`** → Auto deploys to **Render** via **Deploy Hook**.
